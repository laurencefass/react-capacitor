Got it. Since you're developing on a VPS and cannot use a USB connection to install your app, you can follow these steps to build the APK on your VPS and then transfer it to your phone for installation:

Step-by-Step Guide
Build the APK on Your VPS

1.1 Navigate to Your Project Directory:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
1.2 Add Android Platform (if not already added):

sh
Copy code
npx cap add android
1.3 Sync Your Project:

sh
Copy code
npx cap sync android
1.4 Navigate to the Android Directory:

sh
Copy code
cd android
1.5 Build the APK:

sh
Copy code
./gradlew assembleDebug
Locate the APK File

The APK will be located in the app/build/outputs/apk/debug/ directory. The file will be named app-debug.apk.

Transfer the APK to Your Phone
